/* This example has defined classes for sedan, sports and luxury car; these are supposed to be already finished; now we want to add a new method to these class ,we dont have any choice but to make modification inside the class; but due to open closed principle, we will create a new class visitor that will implement the method required by these classes that is getprice() which  calls the metod of the visitor that will implement method for different cars based on the input this. */

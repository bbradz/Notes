This folder includes the Markdown files which I am writing in my personal Obsidian vault in order to construct a self-assembled notated synthesis of the "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" textbook which I have put on the list of textbooks to work through over the course of this Summer. 

Many of these files will not look nearly as pretty as they do in Obsidian and seem like jumbled messes of confusing randomly inserted characters in parts because those characters are typed by me in the context of writing them to be as easily viewable within Obsidian which processes those characters in special ways.

By the time I am done with this book I will have read about, analyzed, and developed personal notation on the tradeoffs around and how to implement 23 different design patterns serving Creational, Structural, and Behavioral OO Design. I will have not only developed by understanding of how to develop large-scale OO systems but have also acquired many new tools of Design Patterns to apply to OO systems in the future in order to be able to develop new applications in flexible and efficient manors.

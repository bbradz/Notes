# Notes
In order to take advantage of my free time during the Summer after my 1st Year at Brown I bought around 2000 pages worth of CS textbooks, looked into the best options for free online courses to teach me the topics I'm looking to learn about, and have (because it's my hobby / passion too) developed a YT and Twitter feed dominated by interesting informational CS content.

This Repo is my attempt to put in one place, for others to view as I go, the self-motivated semi-formal learning I've been doing over the course of the Summer teaching myself a variety of topics about Coding, Data Structures, Data Science, Algorithms, AI, ML.
